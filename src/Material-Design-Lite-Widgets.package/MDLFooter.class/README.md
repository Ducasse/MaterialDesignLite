I am a MDLFooter. 
I'm divided in 3 rows : topSection middleSection bottomSection.

Each section needs a collection of links to work, and a title.

The links in the middle section will be displayed vertically , whereas the top and bottom sections will be displayed horizontally. (it's a choice, you can implement your own footer if you want to do it in an other way).

The middle section can contain multiple Dropdown sections.

Top and Bottom sections can receive only one section (it is still a choice).
